Large screens are populating a variety of settings motivating research on appropriate interaction techniques. While gesture is popularized by depth cameras we contribute with a comparison study showing how eye pointing is a valuable substitute to gesture pointing in dragging tasks. We compare eye pointing combined with gesture selection to gesture pointing and selection. Results clearly show that eye pointing combined with a selection gesture allows more accurate and faster dragging.
Advanced interactive visualization such as in virtual environments and ubiquitous interaction paradigms pose new challenges and opportunities in considering real-time responses to subliminal cues. In this paper, we propose a synthetic reality platform that, combined with psychophysiological recordings, enables us to study in realtime the effects of various subliminal cues. We endeavor to integrate various aspects known to be relevant to implicit perception. The context is of consumer experience and choice of an artifact where the generation of subliminal perception through an intelligent 3D interface controls the spatio-temporal aspects of the information displayed and of the emergent narrative. One novel contribution of this work is the programmable nature of the interface that exploits known perceptive phenomena (e.g. masking, crowding and change blindness) to generate subliminal perception.
We approach the problem of measuring similarity between chromagrams and present two new quantized representations for the task. The first representation is a sequence of optimal transposition index (OTI) values between the global chroma vector and each frame of the chromagram, whereas the second representation uses in similar fashion the global chroma of the query and frames of the target chromagram, thus emphasizing the mutual information of the chromagrams in the representation. The similarity between quantized representations is measured using normalized compression distance (NCD) as the similarity metric, and we experiment with a variant of k-medians algorithm, where the commonly used Euclidean distance has been replaced with NCD, to cluster the chromagrams. The representations and clustering method are evaluated by experimenting how well different cover versions of a composition can be clustered, and based on the experiments, we analyze various parameter settings for the representations. The results are promising and provide possible directions for future work.
We present a system for MIREX 2011 cover song identification task that is based on a method for measuring similarity between polyphonic, symbolic pieces of music [1].
We present a novel compression-based method for measuring similarity between sequences of symbolic, polyphonic music. The method is based on mapping the values of binary chromagrams extracted from MIDI files to tonal centroids, then quantizing the tonal centroid representation values to sequences, and finally measuring the similarity between the quantized sequences using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD). The method is comprehensively evaluated with a test set of classical music variations, and the highest achieved precision and recall values suggest that the proposed method can be applied for similarity measuring. Also, we analyze the performance of the method and discuss what should be taken into consideration when applying the method for measurement tasks.
We examine how approximating Kolmogorov complexity inlyrics can be used for classification in music information retrieval. Using normalized compression distance as a simi-larity measure between lyrics, we perform various evaluations for large sets of lyrics spanning over several genres,lyricists and moods. Results suggest that straightforward compression-based similarity measuring can be applied tolyrics with competent performance.
